# Monitoring and Logging System

## Overview
The monitoring and logging system is like a comprehensive health check system for our healthcare management platform. It helps us ensure everything is running smoothly and helps us quickly identify and fix any issues that arise.

## What We Monitor

### 1. System Health
- **Server Status**: Like checking if all our computers are running properly
- **Database Health**: Ensuring our patient records are accessible
- **Application Performance**: Making sure the system responds quickly
- **Resource Usage**: Monitoring how much of our system's capacity is being used

### 2. User Activity
- **Login Attempts**: Tracking who is accessing the system
- **Feature Usage**: Understanding which parts of the system are most used
- **Error Reports**: Identifying when users encounter problems
- **Session Management**: Monitoring active user sessions

### 3. Security
- **Access Patterns**: Monitoring who accesses what and when
- **Security Events**: Tracking potential security issues
- **Authentication Attempts**: Monitoring login attempts
- **Data Access**: Tracking who views or modifies sensitive information

## How We Monitor

### 1. Prometheus
Prometheus is like a sophisticated monitoring system that:
- Collects data about system performance
- Stores historical information
- Detects unusual patterns
- Triggers alerts when needed

**What it Monitors:**
- Response times
- Error rates
- Resource usage
- System availability

### 2. Grafana
Grafana is like a visual dashboard that:
- Shows real-time system status
- Displays performance graphs
- Provides easy-to-understand metrics
- Helps identify trends

**Key Dashboards:**
- System Overview
- User Activity
- Performance Metrics
- Error Tracking

### 3. Logging System
Our logging system is like a detailed diary that:
- Records all system activities
- Tracks user actions
- Stores error information
- Maintains audit trails

**Types of Logs:**
- Application Logs
- Security Logs
- Error Logs
- Audit Logs

## Alerting System
